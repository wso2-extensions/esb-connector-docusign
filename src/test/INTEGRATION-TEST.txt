Product: Integration tests for WSO2 ESB DocuSign connector

Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.6 or above
 - The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this project automatically.
   If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
   https://github.com/wso2-dev/esb-connectors/tree/master/integration-base

Tested Platform: 

 - Microsoft WINDOWS V-7
 - UBUNTU 14.04
 - WSO2 ESB 5.0.0

Note:
    Set up a new DocuSign account and follow all the instruction given below in step 4 to generate an access token.

Steps to follow in setting integration test.

 1. Download ESB 5.0.0 from official website.

 2. Create a DocuSign developer account using URL https://secure.docusign.com/signup/develop
        Note: Get your free developer account.

 3. Follow the below mentioned steps to add valid certificate to access DocuSign API over https.

        i)   Download the certificate by clicking Demo SSL Certificate link by navigating to 'https://trust.docusign.com/en-us/trust-certifications/docusign-public-certificates/'
        ii)  Go to new ESB 5.0.0 folder and place the downloaded certificate into "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" and
             "<DOCUSIGN_CONNECTOR_HOME>src/test/resources/keystores/products" folders.
        iii) Navigate to "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" using command prompt and execute the following command.

                    keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "CERT_NAME"

             This command will import DocuSign certificate into keystore.
             To import the certificate give "wso2carbon" as password. Press "Y" to complete certificate import process.

             NOTE : CERT_FILE_NAME - Replace CERT_FILE_NAME with the file name that was extracted from DocuSign with the extension. (e.g. demo.docusign.net.crt)
                    CERT_NAME - Replace CERT_NAME with an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. demo.docusign.net)

 4. Follow the bellow mentioned steps to generate the access token:
        i)     Log in to your DocuSign account, and go to the following URLs:
                   https://demo.docusign.net/Member/MemberLogin.aspx?event=logout
        ii)    Go to Admin: This can be done from your DocuSign account by selecting the Go to Admin link in the account settings drop-down menu.
        iii)   In DocuSign Admin, click API and Keys in the left navigation panel and click ADD INTEGRATOR KEY.
        iv)    Click ADD to save the integrator key information.
        v)     Now you got the Integration key.In order to communicate with the DocuSign OAuth service,
               you will need an integrator key, which will serve as your client id,
        vi)    To obtain the baseUrl, Call the getLoginInformation API method call(e.g. https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/v2/)
        v)     Post to Token Endpoint to obtain the accessToken(use getOAuthToken method).
               The client user’s username, password are used, along with the client application’s integrator key (set as “clientId”).

 5. Compress modified ESB as wso2esb-5.0.0.zip and copy that zip file in to location "{DOCUSIGN_CONNECTOR_HOME}/repository/".
